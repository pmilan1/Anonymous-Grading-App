Description: The anonymous grading app enables instructors to grade written exams anonymously. In such an application, the instructor can create barcodes for each student, print these barcodes, and scan the barcodes along with the grades to establish a mapping between the barcode and the corresponding student grade.

Initial Requirements:
1. Capability for an instructor to log into the app with a username and password.
2. Upon logging in, the instructor should be able to add a new class, which entails adding a class roster, creating a class name, and specifying an instructor name.
3. The app should facilitate the addition of exams within a class.
4. For every exam, the app should provide the functionality to generate barcodes for each student.
5. The app should also support the scanning of barcodes and exam grades on paper to create a mapping between the grade and the student.
